title: Reporting bugs and making suggestions
---

Please report bugs using [Jena's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/jena/issues) or 
ASF's [JIRA instance for Jena](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA).  
General suggestions or requests for changes can also be discussed on the [user list](index.html)
or [Jena's GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/apache/jena/discussions)
but are less likely to be accidentally forgotten if you log them into JIRA or a GitHub Issue.

For any security issues please refer to our [Security Advisories](../about_jena/security-advisories.md)
page for how those should be reported and handled.

Patches and other code contributions should also be attached to issues in
JIRA (click on `More Actions > Attach Files`) or made via git pull requests.
See '[Getting Involved](/getting_involved/)'

Please note that ASF requires that all contributions must be covered by an
appropriate license.
